# Stock Price Prediction App

## Description

This project is a stock price prediction application that uses an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to predict stock prices based on historical data.

## Files Included

- `app.py`: The main application script.
- `my_model.keras`: The trained Keras model file used for stock price prediction.
- `stock_data.csv`: The dataset containing historical stock price data.
- `Stock_Price_ANN_Prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the data analysis, model training, and evaluation.

## How to Use

1. Ensure you have Python and necessary libraries installed (e.g., TensorFlow, Keras, pandas, numpy).
2. Run the `app.py` script to start the application.
3. The application uses the pre-trained model `my_model.keras` for predictions.
4. You can explore the notebook `Stock_Price_ANN_Prediction.ipynb` for detailed analysis and model training steps.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow / Keras
- pandas
- numpy

## Notes

- The model file `my_model.keras` is included for prediction purposes.
- The dataset `stock_data.csv` is used for training and testing the model.
